# Hello, I'm 1mposer 

I’m a UAE-based builder, founder of [Tabeq](https://www.tabeq.com), and a public relations student who pivoted into tech by **building instead of waiting**.

### 🧠 What I Do

- 🛠️ I build **real-world software tools** using Firebase, React, Node.js, and AI copilots like Gemini 2.5.
- 🧩 I’m learning full-stack development by actually shipping products—not just tutorials.
- ⚡ I use tools like **n8n** and **Cursor** to move fast, automate workflows, and experiment with new ideas.
- 💼 I’m also an Affiliate Marketing Executive at [Deriv](https://www.deriv.com), automating lead funnels and helping expand our Saudi partner network.
